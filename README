This is a gesture based music player.

This music player has the following gestures

1. Two finger right swipe to move to previous song
2. Two finger left swipe to move to next song
3. Two finger scroll up to increase the song volume
4. Two finger scroll down to decrease the song volume
5. Two finger double tap to play/pause the song

The music plays songs in following modes:
1. Play all the songs in the music library on the SD card of the phone.
2. Play all the songs of an album.
3. Play all the songs of an artist.

All the gesture recognition process has been written by me since Android doesn't provide any api to do gesture recognition for more than one finger gestures.
